    Many people that are living in the world today are carried away by the pleasures of life and sin. They think they are
    living the life now, but they have forgotten that they should be more concerned with their end, than their present state.
    The time we have on earth is a passing wind. There is a place where everyone will report to when they close their eyes in
    death, and be in that place for eternity. My question is, when you get to eternity, on what side will you be? On the side
    of Heaven or Hell?
